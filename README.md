# CIS-521-Homework-7

I had to practice many concepts in Natural Language Processing including "Generation of Text" using n-gram models. I'll be creating a general n-gram model to generate text. I found a good reference material uploaded on website of University of Pennsylvania. This was given as a Homework in UNiversity as CIS 521: Homework 7. Students and Teaching assistants can use it as a reference for teaching or study purposes. They are not supposed to use it or submit it as their Code. The reference link for the official document uploaded by university of Pennsylvania is is here: https://www.seas.upenn.edu/~cis521/Homework/homework7.html
